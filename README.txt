## Introduction:
- This Flask application serves as a simple chatbot interface powered by the LangChain model from OpenAI. It generates responses to user prompts, performs sentiment analysis on the generated responses, and stores the prompts, responses, and their corresponding sentiment in a PostgreSQL database.


## 1. app.py:
- This file contains the main Flask application code, including route definitions, database interactions, and response generation.

# Imports:
- Flask, request, jsonify, render_template: These are Flask modules for creating the web application and handling HTTP requests.
- ChatOpenAI: The LangChain module for interacting with the OpenAI API.
- TextBlob: A library for performing sentiment analysis on text.
- os: Used for environment variable manipulation.
- psycopg2: A PostgreSQL adapter for Python, used for database interactions.

# Initialization:
- Flask app is created.
- LangChain is initialized with the OpenAI API key and desired settings.
- Connection to the PostgreSQL database is established.

# Routes:
- /: The index route returns the index.html template.
- /generate_response: This route handles POST requests for generating responses.
   - It retrieves the user prompt from the form data.
   - Generates a response using LangChain and OpenAI.
   - Performs sentiment analysis on the response.
   - Stores the prompt, response, and sentiment in the PostgreSQL database.
   - Returns the response and sentiment as JSON.

# Database Interaction:
- The application connects to a PostgreSQL database and creates a table named prompts if it does not exist.
- The prompts table stores prompt text, response text, and sentiment for each conversation.


## 2. index.html:
- This file defines the user interface of the web application using HTML and JavaScript.

# HTML Structure:
- The page title and header are defined.
- A form is provided for entering prompts.
- A <div> element is used to display the response and sentiment.

# JavaScript:
- An event listener is added to the form to intercept form submission.
- On form submission, a POST request is sent to the /generate_response route with the entered prompt.
- The response JSON is parsed, and the response and sentiment are displayed on the page.
